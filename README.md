# Cart_pole_Balancing_Using_Reinforcement_Learning
In this project i have tried to balance the Pole on a cart, this is done by the reinforcement learning algorithm called PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), also with the help of stable baselines we are able to implement this project in pytorch.
Please refer the video file if you are having any doubts.
